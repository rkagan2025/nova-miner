# Nova Miner (Subnet 68)

This repository is used by my Subnet 68 (NOVA) miner to store encrypted SMILES submissions for the Bittensor network. It is part of my participation in the NOVA molecular optimization subnet, where miners submit SMILES for validation.

## Purpose
- Stores encrypted SMILES submissions (e.g., `edea2d8ad773bc830d54.txt`) generated by my miner.
- Validators on Subnet 68 access these submissions to score them based on `binding_affinity` (`affinity_difference`).

## Setup
- **Visibility**: Public (required for validator access).
- **Branch**: `main` (default branch for submissions).
- **Files**: Each submission is a `.txt` file containing an encrypted SMILE, uploaded programmatically by the miner.

## Contact
For issues related to Subnet 68 or validator access, please contact me via the Bittensor Discord or GitHub issues.

**Note**: This repository is automatically managed by my miner. Do not manually edit or delete files, as they are part of the Subnet 68 validation process.
